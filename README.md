[00:22.53] 
[00:23.78] Yesterday, somebody whacked out my mural
[00:26.56] That energy'll make you niggas move to Europe
[00:29.63] But it's regular for me, yeah, that's for sure
[00:32.48] The love and hate is definite without a cure
[00:35.47] All this talk is bitch-made, that's on my Lord
[00:38.26] I'll kill 'em all before I let 'em kill my joy
[00:41.36] I done been through it all, what you endure?
[00:43.76] It used to be "fuck that nigga," but now it's plural
[01:09.76] 
[00:46.85] Fuck everybody, that's on my body
[00:49.96] My blick first, then God got me
[00:52.83] I watch 'em pander with them back-handed compliments
[00:56.10] Put they head on a Cuban link as a monument
[00:58.73] I paid homage, and I always mind my business
[01:01.66] I made the-
[01:04.65] I never lost who I am for a rap image
[01:07.59] It's motivation if you wonder how I did it
[01:28.59] 
[01:10.24] Yeah, nigga, go and up your rank
[01:13.32] Know you a god even when they say you ain't
[01:16.04] Yeah, nigga, keep your feelings out the way
[01:19.30] Never let no one put smut up on your name
[01:21.89] Yeah, nigga, keep your head down and work like I do
[01:25.07] But understand everybody ain't gon' like you
[01:27.63] Yeah, nigga, if they say it's love, you've been lied to
[01:30.93] A couple rules of engagements, I'ma guide you
[01:53.43] 
[01:34.82] Que reflejan tu mirada
[01:39.01] La noche, tú y yo
[01:47.51] 
[01:42.39] Ridin' in my GNX with Anita Baker in the tape deck, it's gon' be a sweet love
[01:47.81] Fuck apologies, I wanna see y'all geeked up
[01:50.84] Don't acknowledge me, then maybe we can say it's fair
[01:53.78] Take it to the internet, and I'ma take it there
[01:56.36] Miss my uncle Lil' Mane, he said that he would kill me if I didn't make it
[02:00.22] Now, I'm possessed by a spirit and they can't take it
[02:02.83] He used to bump Tha Carter III, I held my Rollie chain proud
[02:05.89] Irony, I think my hard work let Lil Wayne down
[02:08.79] Whatever, though, call me crazy, everybody questionable
[02:36.29] 
[02:11.60] Turn me to an eskimo, I drew the line and decimals
[02:14.54] Snoop posted "Taylor Made," I prayed it was the edibles
[02:17.46] I couldn't believe it, it was only right for me to let it go
[02:20.46] Won the Super Bowl, and Nas the only one congratulate me
[02:23.40] All these niggas agitated, I'm just glad they're showin' they faces
[02:26.32] Quite frankly, plenty artists, but they outdated
[02:29.28] Old-ass flows, tryna convince me that you they favorite
[02:32.18] This is not for lyricists, I swear, it's not the sentiments
[02:35.17] Fuck a double entendre, I want y'all to feel this shit
[03:02.17] 
[02:38.03] Old soul, bitch, I probably built them pyramids
[02:40.93] Ducking strays when I rap battled in the Nickersons
[02:43.94] Where you from? Not where I'm from, we all indigenous
[02:46.67] Against all odds, I squabbled up for them dividends
[02:49.65] Against all odds, I showed up as a gentleman
[02:52.70] I done lost plenty friends, 16 to be specific
[02:55.69] Put that on my kids' children, we gon' see the future first
[02:58.54] They like, "Dot big trippin," I just want what I deserve
[03:01.47] What bridge they done burnt? All of them, it's over with
[03:04.40] I'm doin' what COVID did, they'll never get over it
[03:29.90] 
[03:07.27] Yeah, nigga, go and up your rank
[03:10.49] Know you a god even when they say you ain't
[03:13.22] Yeah, nigga, keep your feelings out the way
[03:16.57] Never let no one put smut up on your name
[03:18.90] Yeah, nigga, keep your head down and work like I do
[03:22.25] But understand everybody ain't gon' like you
[03:24.84] Yeah, nigga, if they say it's love, you've been lied to
[03:28.05] A couple rules of engagements, here to guide you
[03:52.05] 
[03:30.67] Niggas from my city couldn't entertain old boy
[03:33.98] Promisin' bank transactions and even bitcoin
[03:36.75] I never peaced it up, that shit don't sit well with me
[03:39.78] Before I take a truce, I'll take 'em to Hell with me
[03:42.78] If that money got in the hands of a crash dummy
[03:45.59] Could jeopardize my family and burden the ones who love me
[03:48.63] Niggas mad 'cause I decided not to pretend
[03:51.33] Y'all stay politically correct, I'ma do what I did
[03:54.48] Ain't no sympathy here, this shit's hilarious
[04:16.98] 
[03:57.06] It's a lot of opinions, but no power to carry it
[04:00.02] 2025, they're still movin' on some scary shit
[04:02.97] Tell 'em quit they job, and pay the real niggas they severance
[04:05.72] Don't insult my inteligence, I'm not just for the television
[04:08.76] Teleport the bullets rolled, and dig up on my relatives
[04:11.51] Okay, nigga, let's settle it, these niggas been fake loyal
[04:14.27] Since y'all pandering to choose a side, let me do it for you
[04:17.23] Okay, fuck your hip-hop, I watched the party just die
[04:20.16] Niggas cackling about-
[04:31.16] 
[04:21.77] While all of y'all is on trial
[04:23.12] Niggas thought I was antisocial when I stayed inside my house
[04:26.20] You better off to have one woman, never think tricky right now
[04:29.04] You niggas live in denial, and fuck anybody empathetic to the other side, I vow
[04:33.43] A bitch nigga love bitch niggas, they exist with them in style
[04:36.47] Exterminate them right now
[04:37.93] Make Katt Williams and them proud, the truth 'bout to get loud
[04:40.74] New juice is out of my cup, I sober up, and knock 'em all off
[05:11.24] 
[04:43.44] Don't let no white comedian talk about no black woman, that's law
[04:46.54] I know propaganda work for them, and fuck whoever that's close to them
[04:49.39] The niggas, that coon, the niggas that being groomed, slide on both of them
[04:52.29] You either have Cap'n Crunch and proceeded to put water in it
[04:54.90] Pulled over by the law, you riding dirty, so you can't argue with them
[04:57.76] Then make it to be a star, bare your soul and put your heart up in it
[05:00.87] Well, I did
[05:01.53] Wacced the murals out, but it ain't no legend if my legend ends
